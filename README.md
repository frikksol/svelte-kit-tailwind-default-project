# Default SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS Typescript project

This is a project I created to quickly get up and running when starting a new project.

It is set up with the tools I commonly use for web-apps in order to skip the setup process
when I want to test something out quickly.

# Get started
In order to get up and running with the project. Follow the commands below:
``` bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:frikksol/svelte-kit-tailwind-default-project.git
cd svelte-kit-tailwind-default-project

# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Happy Coding 👨‍💻
